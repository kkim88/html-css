    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>My name is Katherine Kim and I'm currently located in Chicago, IL. My birthday is December 25th, 1988 and it's the worst possible birthday you can have. I went to Illinois Institute of Technology and have a bachelor's degree in Information Technology Management.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Video Games</li>
            <p>I have been playing video games since I was a child, starting with the Sega Genesis. I currently play mainly on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Playstation 4. Final Fantasy XIV currently owns my soul.</p>
            <li>Writing</li>
            <p>I have been writing ever since I was a teenager and mainly do fiction stories. Sometimes I even write and type down what I come up with! No, I will never write a book.</p>
            <li>Trading Card Games</li>
            <p>I love collectable trading card games. Currently, I am just a collector, but I am also an avid player. My favorite TCG is Yu-Gi-Oh!, but I am also familiar with Magic: The Gathering and the Pokémon TCG.</p>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <p>I enjoy cooking a lot and learning new recipes. Now if only I'd do it more...</p>
